## Hi there 👋

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ How about jLab?  
jLab is a little Research group, until now we have two guys and a dog ^_^.

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
If you want to contribute to jLab, you can walk through our repo and find what you are interested in, and make PRs.

👩‍💻 Useful resources 
We build different repos and we have some logics you should know:
1. [FDDF:Fast DApp Develop Flow](https://github.com/jLab-tech/FDDF) + [jLab-Web3-Fullstack-Practice](https://github.com/jLab-tech/jLab-Web3-Fullstack-Practice) , are the routine of Web3 Stack, all the Power Practices are in there.
3. Or you can visit our Blogs: [https://blog.jlab.tech](https://blog.jlab.tech)
4. Our products is here: [Textverse](https://textverse.org),[gNFT]()
where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
Our team is full time Web3 builders and if you think what we have done is helpful, can buy us a coffe.
