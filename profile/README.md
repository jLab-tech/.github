## 4.BlockChain/ Web3: jLab.tech Website Dev Plan
### [jLab的网站](https://jlab.tech)技术选型+功能设计

1.Ether.js访问inject web3，用wagmi增强hooks，实现基础功能

2.React体系，务实通用，用Next实现路由等自动配置

3.MUI，看起来好像比较通用，先用这个吧

4.静态网页加郭宇的CoderforDAO的合约框架魔改（合适的话提pr）

5.创建一个可配置的独立研究小组DAO，有基础的会员体系，grant等

6.创建Growth NFT系列

7.找到合适的AI generate art来创造NFT，好玩

8.完成后对所有XStack18公众号开放本框架，通过随机数字验证，接入web3auth（中心化），来领取NFT

9.开源，都在jLab的repo下面分别建立，视频会发布在bilibili,

9.以上知识点会单独文档，独立在fullstack里面讲解过程和技巧
